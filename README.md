# Sat solvers in C++ 11
- Implementation of satisfiability solving methods in C++ 11 and a way to benchmark them effectively.

# Short description of this repository

- This repository has the main objective of benchmarking popular sat solving methods/algorithms for the purpose of ***science*** ~~(but also to complete an assigment for university)~~.
- The main algorithms I will be tackleing will be Resolution, DP, DPLL, CDCL _and maybe some more if i have the time_.
- I will try to optimize everything to the best of my abilites and probably fail but my hopes are that i will learn a thing or two about the problem of satisfiablity.

# Why C++?

- Why not i guess.
- But for real now i think this is a great oportunity to really understand C++ and also because everybody says that it's faster than python.
- **And everybody knows that _speed_ is key.**

# Requirements and how to run the thing

- There is nothing to run at the moment so ig this is TBD.

# ToDO list

1. Actually implement the algorithims.
2. Investigate the use of multithreading and other optimizations.
3. Find a way to store benchmarks.
4. Maybe write a script to get everything working nicely and make testing easier.
5. Other stuff (i am for sure not finishing this on time).
