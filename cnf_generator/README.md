# CNF Generator

- This python script generates CNF files just so i don't have to search for them on the internet.
- _Apperently there is a library for everything._

# How to use

- Just open a terminal and type `python3 generate_random_cnf.py --vars {number_of_var} --clauses {number_of_clauses} --lits {number_of_lit_in_clauses} --out {name}.cnf`
- After running in the script it should output a cnf file with the generated thing.

# ToDo

- maybe it should say if the thing is sat or not ig
